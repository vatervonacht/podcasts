# Walter Block Interview

The **Show Intro** and **Guest Intro** could be pre-recorded. Haven't decided
yet.

## Show Intro
Tim:

> Uncommonly Libertarian, Episode TBD.
> 
> (Intro Music and show intro)
> 
> Hello everyone, Tim Rozmajzl here with a fantastic episode.  I will introduce
> my guest in a moment.  But first, joining me for the interview today are Glenn
> and JB - my very good friends and fellow libertarians.  Glenn, JB, good to be
> with you two again.  
> 
> (Glenn and JB say hello)

## Guest Intro
Tim (pre-recorded?):

> Folks, we have a very special guest today, and we are honored and grateful to
> have him here with us.  Walter Block is a giant in libertarian circles.  He
> is the Harold E. Wirth Eminent Scholar Endowed Chair in Economics at Loyola
> University and a senior fellow at the Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama.  
>
> He is the author of numerous books, perhaps most notably, and what I would
> consider to be a classic, *Defending the Undefendable*.  Walter's book
> *Privatization of Roads and Highways*, which features prominently on the
> Uncommonly Libertarian website, should be read by anyone interested in how
> these problems might be solved in a libertarian world.  And his book, *I
> Chose Liberty*, is particularly interesting given the theme of this show. 
> We'll get to that a little later in the show.
>
> What I find most incredible about Walter is the fact that he has published
> over 500 - is it over 600 now? - peer-reviewed articles in various journals.
> And, as if that wasn't amazing enough, his *students* have collectively
> published over 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals. Quite a track record
> to say the least. (CHECK ON NUMBER OF UNDERGRADS WHO HAVE PUBLISHED - I 
> THINK IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER IF NOT EXCLUSIVELY UNDERGRADS)
>
> Walter Block, welcome to the show.

(Let Walter Respond)

### Questions/Topics

#### Journey
Having read and heard your background in the past, I know that your journey
kind of started with Ayn Rand and eventually found its way to Murray
Rothbard. Can you tell us the story of your journey to libertarianism.

#### Intellectual Challenges
Intellectually, philosophically, where did you encounter the biggest struggles? 
And how did you work through them?

#### Relationship Challenges
It's not an uncommon experience for libertarians, especially
anarcho-libertarians, to encounter tension in personal relationships.  There
are people in my own life with whom it would be a mistake to get into certain
conversations.  Without naming names, were there relationships that suffered or
were severed as the result?  And were you able to bring anyone along with you?

#### *I Chose Liberty* 
In your book, *I Chose Liberty*, you compiled stories from 82 libertarian
thinkers relating their respective intellectual journeys, and you included
your own.  Talk about some of the experiences in pulling that work
together, and if you could tell us about a couple of the more surprising 
and interesting stories that you heard.

I want to read a brief excerpt from *I Chose Liberty* and then have you comment
on it.  You said:

> On the other hand, this guy, the author of this book [Man, Economy, and
> State], was actually friendly to me, a punk kid who had done nothing to be
> worthy of it. (He kept telling me to call him “Murray,” not “Prof.
> Rothbard,” something that was very difficult for me). How could I ever
> deserve such treatment?

Of course, you were referring to the great Murray Rothbard.  How did that
experience with Murray influence the way you interact with, not just young
people, but anyone who might show that glimmer of curiosity in some of 
our ideas?  And what lessons do you think Murray left us that might
help in spreading the ideas of liberty 

  
#### Wrap-up
Are there ideas, concepts even today that you're not quite sure you've settled
in your own mind?  Are there gaps in libertarian thought that you think are
worthy of more attention?

#### Promotion
Walter, how can people find you out there?  Tell us about any projects you've
got going - books or otherwise - that might be interesting to our listeners.
