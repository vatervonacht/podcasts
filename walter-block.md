> (Intro Music and show intro)
> 
> Hello everyone, Tim Rozmajzl here with a fantastic episode.  I will introduce
> my guest in a moment.  But first, joining me for the interview today are Glenn
> and JB - my very good friends and fellow libertarians.  Glenn, JB, good to be
> with you two again.  
> 
> (Glenn and JB say hello)

## Guest Intro
Tim:

> Folks, we have a very special guest today, and we are honored to have him
> here with us today.  Walter Block is a giant in libertarian circles.  He is
> the Harold E. Wirth Eminent Scholar Endowed Chair in Economics at Loyola
> University and a senior fellow at the Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama.  
>
> He is the author of numerous books, perhaps most notably, and what I would
> consider to be a classic, *Defending the Undefendable*.  Walter's book
> *Privatization of Roads and Highways*, which features prominently on the
> Uncommonly Libertarian website, should be read by anyone interested in how
> these problems might be solved in a libertarian world.  Now, his book, *I
> Chose Liberty*, is particularly interesting given the theme of this show, and
> we'll get to that later in the show.
>
> What I find most incredible about Walter is the fact that he has published
> over 500 - is it over 600 now? - peer-reviewed articles in various journals.
> And, more than that, his *students* have collectively published over 100
> articles in peer-reviewed journals. Quite a track record to say the least.
>
> Walter, welcome to the show.

### Questions/Topics

1. Tell the story of your journey to libertarianism.
2. Intellectually, philosophically, where did you encounter the biggest struggles? 
   And how did you work through them?
3. It's not an uncommon experience for libertarians, especially anarcho-libertarians,
   to encounter tension in personal relationships.  There are people in my own life
   with whom it would be a mistake to get into certain conversations.  Without naming 
   names, were there relationships that suffered or were severed as the result?  And
   did you bring anyone along with you?
