## Guest Intro (Recorded Offline)

> Folks, we have a very special guest today, and we are honored and grateful to
> have him here with us.  Walter Block is a giant in libertarian circles.  He
> is the Harold E. Wirth Eminent Scholar Endowed Chair in Economics at Loyola
> University and a senior fellow at the Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama.  
>
> He is the author of numerous books, perhaps most notably, and what I would
> consider to be a classic, *Defending the Undefendable*.  Walter's book
> *Privatization of Roads and Highways*, which features prominently on the
> Uncommonly Libertarian website, should be read by anyone interested in how
> these problems might be solved in a libertarian society.  And his book *I
> Chose Liberty* is particularly interesting and relevant given the theme of
> this show.  We'll get to that a little later in the show.
>
> What I find most incredible about Walter is the astonishing fact that he 
> has published close to 600 articles in refereed journals.
> And, as if that wasn't enough, he has also co-authored over 100
> articles in refereed journals and law reviews with *undergraduate students*!
> This is a quite a track record to say the least - hard for me to fathom.

(opening conversation, publications, how the interview came about)

### Questions/Topics

#### Journey
Now, I know you weren't born a libertarian or into a libertarian family. 
Can you tell us the story of your journey to libertarianism - where you
started philosophically - the "pre-libertarian days", how you came to 
question your views, and who/what influenced you along the way?

#### Intellectual Challenges
Intellectually, philosophically, where did you encounter the biggest struggles? 
And how did you work through them?

#### Relationship Challenges
It's not an uncommon experience for libertarians, especially
anarcho-libertarians, to encounter tension in personal relationships.  There
are people in my own life with whom it would be a mistake to get into certain
conversations.  Without naming names, were there relationships that suffered or
were severed as the result?  And were you able to bring anyone along with you?

Were there any lessons from those experiences that you could share with 
the audience?  What would you have changed in your approach?  What really
worked well?

#### *I Chose Liberty* 
In your book *I Chose Liberty* you compiled stories from 82 libertarian
thinkers relating their personal intellectual journeys - and you included your
own.  Can you talk about the process in pulling that work together, and if you could
tell us about a couple of the more surprising and interesting stories that you
heard?

I want to read a brief excerpt from your personal account in  *I Chose Liberty* 
and then have you comment on it.  You said:

> On the other hand, this guy, the author of this book [Man, Economy, and
> State], was actually friendly to me, a punk kid who had done nothing to be
> worthy of it. (He kept telling me to call him “Murray,” not “Prof.
> Rothbard,” something that was very difficult for me). How could I ever
> deserve such treatment?

Of course, you were referring to the great Murray Rothbard.  How did your
relationship with Murray carry over and influence the way you interact with, 
not just young people, but anyone who might show a faint glimmer of curiosity 
in libertarian thought?  

Our goal on this show is to tell as many varied stories as possible that relate
personal 'conversions', so to speak, to libertarianism.  And it really is a
process - typically not some epiphany that happens like a bolt of lightning. I
personally find them very compelling, including your own.  What are some other
ways libertarians can be effective in spreading these ideas?  Or conversely,
what are some mistakes that you see many libertarians make when engaging in
discourse with others?
  
#### "Bonus" Question
Are there ideas, concepts even today that you're not quite sure you've settled
in your own mind?  Are there gaps in libertarian thought that you think are
worthy of more attention?

#### Promotion
Can you tell us about the latest research topics that we can look forward to
seeing published in the near future by you and by your students?

Are there any books or other projects in the works?

Walter, where should people go to find out more about you and your work?  

#### Wrap Up
Walter, it's been a delight to have you on the show, and thank you for carving 
time out of your busy schedule to spend with us.

### Outro - Will be recorded and edited later.
