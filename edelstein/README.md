(opening conversation, how the interview came about)

### Questions/Topics

#### Clinical Psychology and REBT

* Can you talk about what it was that got you interested in psychology and how
you found your way to being a practicing clinical psychologist?
* Can you describe a "day in the life?" 
* What are some of the more common misconceptions about the profession that 
you encounter?
* OK, tell us about REBT.  What is it, and what first got you interested
in the approach?
* Does REBT have detractors? What's their main beef?

#### Journey to Libertarianism
Now, I know you weren't born a libertarian or into a libertarian family. 
Can you tell us the story of your journey to libertarianism - where you
started philosophically - the "pre-libertarian days", how you came to 
question your views, and who/what influenced you along the way?

##### Influences
* Walter Block
* Murray Rothbard
* Albert Ellis
* Jeffrey Rogers Hummel
* David Ramsey Steele

#### Questions
* Where did you encounter the biggest struggles with libertarian philosophy, 
and how did you work through them?
* Politically speaking, is your field dominated by those on the left?
* Do you think political beliefs influence how practitioners do psychotherapy?
* How did your switch to libertarianism transform your view of human nature, and
how did it affect your approach to treating patients?
* Are there regulations in your field that seemed well intentioned when they were
passed but have had deleterious effects on doctorsâ€™ relations with their
patients and tie your hands in terms of providing the kind of treatment you
think patients would benefit from most?
* One insight economics, in particular the Austrian School and Public Choice,
offers is that special interests are often behind regulations in any given
industry. What are the special interests that dominate in your field? Can you
talk about how this plays out in the treatment of patients?
* Do you get involved in conversations with your fellow therapists about politics
and the various ways political beliefs can come into play in therapy? What
about the special interests that dominate in the field? Do most therapists you
talk to have a positive view of regulations?
* What is the relationship, if any, between REBT and libertarianism? Have other
groups tried to co-opt REBT in support of views counter to libertarinism?

#### Projects
* Are there any projects you're working on that our listeners should be aware of?
